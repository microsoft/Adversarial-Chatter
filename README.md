## Description
>Adversarial chatter is a project  that explores adversarial behavior in AI or cybersecurity contexts. Currently simulates or analyzes adversarial interactions in the context of elicitation to better train individuals against social engineering threats. 


## Agents 
AutoGen is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve tasks. AutoGen aims to streamline the development and research of agentic AI, much like PyTorch does for Deep Learning. It offers features such as agents capable of interacting with each other, facilitates the use of various large language models (LLMs) and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.
