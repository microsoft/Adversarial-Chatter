# ADV-CHATTER


## Agents 
AutoGen is an open-source programming framework for building AI agents and facilitating cooperation among multiple agents to solve tasks. AutoGen aims to streamline the development and research of agentic AI, much like PyTorch does for Deep Learning. It offers features such as agents capable of interacting with each other, facilitates the use of various large language models (LLMs) and tool use support, autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent conversation patterns.

## Description
>ADV-CHATTER Is a network of learning agents, that are specialized in specific areas of security.  The three agents are specialized in a particular area of security such as 'Data Exposure recognition', 'Software and website Security Flaws', 'Social Engineering' Between these three agents, they are what is being called 'Adverserial Chatter', a way to generate a threat vector of what an adversary may see against our own systems, websites, social media platforms.

### Note
>In order to test the feasibility of such a system, we would need a site to target. To avoid any web-scraping legal issues we generated fake social media data, on a fake social media site that could be scraped and allow the agents to glean information only from what they could find.

## Prerequisites

```
1. Download and install VSCode
2. Download and install Python => 3.10

## Benefits of an LLM Chat Bot
1. Natural Language Interaction:
LLM chatbots allow you to interact using natural language, which is more intuitive than formulating search queries or navigating through structured data.
Conversational Context: You can ask follow-up questions and the chatbot can maintain context, making it easier to refine or expand on information without needing to rephrase or start over.
2. Efficiency and Speed:
Direct Answers: Instead of sifting through multiple search results, an LLM chatbot can provide direct answers or summaries, saving time.
Summarization: LLMs can condense large amounts of information into concise summaries, making it easier to digest complex topics quickly.
3. Personalization:
Context Awareness: LLM chatbots can remember past interactions and tailor responses based on your specific needs, preferences, or previous queries.
Adaptive Learning: Some LLMs can adapt over time, learning from interactions to provide more relevant and personalized responses.
4. Complex Query Handling:
Handling Nuanced Queries: LLM chatbots can understand and process complex or multi-part questions that may be difficult to search for using traditional methods.
Inference and Reasoning: LLMs can infer meaning, draw connections, and provide reasoning-based answers that might not be directly available in the data.
5. Contextual Decision-Making:
Guidance and Recommendations: LLM chatbots can offer recommendations or decision support based on the context of your queries, which is particularly useful in fields like healthcare, finance, or technology.
Scenario Simulation: You can explore hypothetical scenarios or what-if questions that LLMs can simulate or provide insights on, which isnâ€™t easily achievable through regular data search.
6. Multimodal Capabilities:
Combining Data Types: LLMs can integrate and provide insights from diverse data types (e.g., text, tables, images), offering a more comprehensive view than a search through text-based data alone.
Interactive Tools: Some LLM chatbots can execute code, manipulate data, or perform calculations in real-time, offering a more dynamic interaction than static search results.
